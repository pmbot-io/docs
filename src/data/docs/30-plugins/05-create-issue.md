# Create issue

This plugin allows you to open an issue.

<div class="code-group" data-props='{ "lineNumbers": ["true"] }'>

````yaml
version: '1'
updates:
- packageManager:
    name: create-issue
    config:
      title: 'Automated update of {{slug}} {{statusEmoji}}'
      additionalText: ''
      assignees:
        - ...
      closeOpen: true
````

</div>

To be able to authenticate with your Git provider, this plugin needs to have a token:
- with **Gitlab**, set an environment variable named `GITLAB_TOKEN` which should contain a [Gitlab personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html)
- with **Github**, set an environment variable named `GITHUB_TOKEN` which should contain a [Github personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)

}
```

</div>
