# Circle CI

## Provider settings

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | The name of your CI provider |
| URL | The URL of your Circle CI instance. You must turn on the **Custom URL** toggle for this parameter to be visible. |

## Project settings

| Field | Config version | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Circle Project Path | all | The path of your Circle CI project. It should have the form `<vcs-type>/<org>/<repo>`, for example `github/jsmith/foo`. |
| Config version | all | The version of your `.circle/config.yml`. |
| Api token | all | The API token will **have** to be a [**Personal API Token**](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-personal-api-token). We are aware that [project access tokens](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-project-api-token) are safer since they grant read-only access to your Circle CI account, but unfortunately, their new API has dropped usage of those tokens. More info [here](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/feedback-wanted-moving-from-v1-1-job-triggering-to-v2-pipeline-triggering/33494). |
| Update job name | 2.0 | The name of the update job in your `.circle/config.yml`. |

<div class="blockquote" data-props='{ "mod": "warning" }'>

Support for `2.0` configuration should end some time in 2020 as Circle CI will drop some API endpoints that we use for v2 configurations. More info [here](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/feedback-wanted-moving-from-v1-1-job-triggering-to-v2-pipeline-triggering/33494).

## Project Setup

### CI config file

You'll need to update your `.circle/config.yml`.

The variables marked with `{{...}}` are prefilled in the code snippets provided in your [project setup](/core/projects#setup).

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{{PMBOT_URL}}` | The URL of the Pmbot backend. |
| `{{PMBOT_PROJECT_ID}}` | The ID of your Pmbot project. You can find this ID in the URL of your UI when you are on the project details page. |
| `{{PMBOT_TOKEN}}` | Your [`PMBOT_TOKEN`](#pmbot_token) |

If you are using version `2`, you'll want to use the following config, and in the [project CI settings](#ci-provider-project-configuration), make sure you have selected **Config Version** **2.0** and that you have set the **job name** to `update`.

<div class="code-group" data-props='{ "lineNumbers": ["true"], "labels": [".circleci/config.yml"] }'>

```yaml
version: 2 # or 2.0

jobs:
  #
  update:
    docker:
      - image: pmbot/bot

      PMBOT_PROJECT_ID: {{PMBOT_PROJECT_ID}}

      PMBOT_TOKEN {{PROJECT_TOKEN}}

workflows:

If you are using config version `2.1`, you will need to [enable pipelines](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/build-processing/) in your Circle CI account, which allows you to use conditional workflows. Also, make sure you have selected **Config Version** **2.1** in your [project CI settings](#ci-provider-project-configuration).
