To be able to authenticate with your Git provider, this plugin needs to have a token:
- with **Gitlab**, set an environment variable named `GITLAB_TOKEN` which should contain a [Gitlab personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html)
- with **Github**, set an environment variable named `GITHUB_TOKEN` which should contain a [Github personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)

## title

Allows you to customize issue title.

This [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#what-is-handlebars) template is passed the following context:

<div class="code-group" data-props='{ "lineNumbers": ["true"] }'>

```json
{
    "slug": "myPm",
    "status": "myStatus",
    "statusEmoji": "ðŸš€"
}
```

</div>

| Property | Description |
